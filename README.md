# TiledLand: Polygon-based simulation engine.

This is a dead branch. The main idea was to test Shapely, based on libGEOS, but several conclusion :

- Not well documented : it is hard to do find how to do things : i.e. change Point coordinate for instance...
- Strangely managed Object, so it is not possible to apply hineritance, and so on 
- As a result, my strategy to bypass the limitation go on re-instanciate objects, but with a huge cost on the code efficiency...

Use the pytest tool in comparison with the v0.1.0 version to understand my point....
